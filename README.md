### The purpose of this kickstarter analysis was to determine the success rate of a kickstarter for a play based on the data given from all over the world from a wide range of funding goals. 
## Analysis
### Based upon the data analysis shows the kickstarter can be successful. Here shown in graphs "Theater Outcomes Based by Launch Date" and "Outcomes Based on Goals".

## Results
### Two conclusions based on "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" 1. Most successful "Theater" kickstarters are during the months of April and August as seen in the Analysis graph. 2. December is the worst month to launch a theater kickstarter campaign based on the graph.
### A conclusion based on "Outcomes Based on Goals" would be kickstarter campaign goals less than $1000.00 to $4999.00 are the most likely to be successful based on the graph.
### A Limitation of the data set would be lack of explanation of the column such as "Spotlight". A table showing the relationship between Spotlight "true" or "false" could have a positive or negative correlation between successful or failed and true or false from the Spotlight column.
